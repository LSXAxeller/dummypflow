ProseFlow is a cross-platform desktop application that integrates powerful AI text processing into your daily workflow. With a simple hotkey, you can access a menu of customizable AI actions to proofread, summarize, refactor, or transform text in *any* application‚Äîbe it your code editor, browser, or word processor.

Its unique hybrid engine allows you to seamlessly switch between the world's best cloud-based LLMs and private, offline-capable models running directly on your own hardware.

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

ProseFlow is built using a modern, layered architecture inspired by **Clean Architecture**, promoting separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

*   **`ProseFlow.Core`**: The domain layer. Contains the core business models, enums, and interfaces for repositories and services. It has zero dependencies on other layers.
*   **`ProseFlow.Application`**: The application layer. It orchestrates the business logic using services, DTOs, and application-specific events. It depends only on `Core`.
*   **`ProseFlow.Infrastructure`**: The infrastructure layer. Contains all implementations of external concerns, including:
    *   **Data Access:** Entity Framework Core with SQLite using the Repository & Unit of Work patterns.
    *   **AI Providers:** Implementations for Cloud (`LlmTornado`) and Local (`LLamaSharp`) providers.
    *   **OS Services:** Cross-platform hotkeys (`SharpHook`), clipboard access, and active window tracking.
*   **`ProseFlow.UI`**: The presentation layer. A cross-platform desktop application built with **Avalonia** and the **ShadUI** component library, following the **MVVM** pattern.
